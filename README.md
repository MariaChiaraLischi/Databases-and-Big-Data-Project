# Databases and Big Data Project

This project was completed as part of the coursework for the course Databases and Big Data during the Bachelorâ€™s degree program in Management and Computer Science at Luiss Guido Carli University. The project involved designing an Entity-Relationship (ER) model and implementing it in SQL using data sourced from Kaggle. After defining the relational schema, the project required developing an application to load the data into an SQL database, with MySQL as the DBMS. Once the data was loaded, the application was expected to enable users to execute predefined queries based on the analysis conducted during the project.

 To use our SQL-based application follow these steps:
 - Run 'Database_builder.py' (the script will ask as input the password for your localhost-root sql instance)
 - Run 'Application.py' (the script will ask as input the password for your localhost-root sql instance)
 - Enjoy the 6 queries available, the first of which is customizable (you can apply specific filters on the entire dataset)
